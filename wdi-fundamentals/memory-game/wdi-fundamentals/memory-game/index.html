  <h2 class="first">Instructions</h2>
  <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
  <h2 class="first">Why We Play</h2>
  <p>We play because it's fun. We enjoy the thrill of the challenge. There is nothing but the challenge and the thrill of getting over the hurdle. Is there any other way to play a game?</p>
